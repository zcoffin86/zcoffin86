# 👋 Hi, I'm Zach 😁

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 10+ years of experience building resilient, user-centered systems — ESG software platforms, regulatory compliance SAAS, enterprise AV control interfaces.

I care deeply about technical clarity, environmental impact, and making long-lived systems that don't just "work," but work *well*. I'm especially drawn to projects in climate tech, public infrastructure, or other domains where engineering can serve people and planet alike.

## 💻 What I've Worked On

- 🌱 **Sustainability-focused SaaS** at [Optera](https://opteraclimate.com) – built UI features and CI/CD pipelines to help enterprises track and reduce their emissions.
- 🐾 **Regulatory tech** at GlobalVetLINK – implemented mission-critical veterinary health software with consistent delivery and tight uptime targets.
- 🎛️ **AV/VR Systems** at Mechdyne – delivered virtual reality and telepresence projects for academic and enterprise clients worldwide.
- 🧑‍🔧 **IT Support & Infrastructure** at Iowa State University – managed lab systems and helped migrate educational resources to digital platforms.

## 🧠 Skills & Tools

`Java` • `TypeScript` • `React` • `Next.js` • `Grails` • `Docker` • `PostgreSQL` • `Linux`  
CI/CD pipelines • Accessibility • Legacy systems modernization • Developer mentoring

## 🌍 Interests

- Building software that supports decarbonization and sustainable practices
- Participatory design, inclusive tech, and digital public goods
- Urban cycling, community repair, and local mutual aid projects
